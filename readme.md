**User Friendly Detials**

This site is not a complete Replica, it's a copy with some enhancements especially focusing on backend and making frontend look better.

Here is an overview about site:
> Home and othe basic front end pages for site look up and providing the details to student which he/she needs.
> Then for students there is a section of login as well as courses which take them to student dashboard which is logged in by mobile otp if you have added some courses they will be displayed there as your courses
> That's all for the students which is going through courses taking courses removing courses and all
> If you want to purchase any course it'll take you to the payment gateway page for rest payment and all

Then comes for the admin who needs to add more courses // updated the existing courses // delete the courses // read the existing course (CRUD)
> To login the dashboard you just have to add dashboard after URL
> It'll take you to admin login page you can login using login details (for login details contact me ðŸ˜Š)
> Then the admin dashboard opens up in which there are complete CRUD operation for the courses

**My main focus while making this was to focus on making a well documented project with meaningful comments and then making it open source so that any one can use it freely without any hesitation and can even update it according to their needs too. If you face any problem while cloning or changing the project please let me know in the issue section. I'll be glad to help or suggest a way .
 
** Waiting for everyone's pull request // issues // and updates even love to collaborate with other people for community . Love to expand it more and collaborate with others to take the project to the next level .
